## Social media as evidence
Something about using social media as evidence.

## Which elements should I collect? 
Here are some of the different Instagram elements that you could collect. Consider what you need to suit your purposes.

- Instagram interface
- Media (Image, Video, Album)
- Captions
- Comments (timestamp, text, ID)
- Post metadata (e.g. URL, ID, Timestamp)
- Like count
- User profile (ID, username, bio, followers count, name, profile pic, etc)
- Your browserâ€™s interaction with Instagram site

## What characteristics of those elements are important?
After you've decided which elements you need to collect, consider what _properties_ of that element you need to preserve while collecting. Broadly speaking, you can think of properties in these categories:

- Intellectual content
- Context / Environment
- Structure (e.g. relationship to other components)
- Look and feel
- Behaviour

For example, if you're collecting comments, do you just need a plain-text of the comment? Or do you need to preserve the way it looked on the page? Do you need to be able to click on the links?

Answering these questions will help you decide what [tool](https://yvonneng.github.io/test-insta/tools-overview) to use to collect the elements you need, in the form you need them in. 

## But how do I know what I need?
It is important to consider the intended purpose of collecting, and what the requirements are for that use. Spend some time researching. It may be helpful to consult external standards or protocols in your field (e.g. [Berkeley Protocol...](add link)
