# HAR files

HAR stands for HTTP Archive format. It's a text-based format (in JSON notation) for logging your web browser's interaction with a web site. Developers and testers use it for troubleshooting performance issues. 

It can also be useful if you need to capture data about your data collection process. **But remember: Your HAR file may include your personal data,** such as the contents of the site you are browsing, your cookies, and any information you submit to the website like passwords.
