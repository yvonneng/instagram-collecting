## Social media as evidence
Something about using social media as evidence...

## Which elements should I collect? 
There are different Instagram elements that you could collect. Consider what you might need to suit your purposes:

- Media (Image, Video, Album)?
- Captions?
- Comments (timestamp, text, ID)?
- Post metadata (e.g. URL, ID, Timestamp)?
- Like count?
- User profile (ID, username, bio, followers count, name, profile pic, etc)?
- Instagram interface?
- Your browser’s interaction with Instagram site?

## What characteristics of those elements are important to capture?
After you've decided which elements to collect, consider what _properties_ of each element you need to capture while collecting. Here are some broad categories to consider:

- Intellectual content
- Context / Environment
- Structure (e.g. relationship to other components)
- Look and feel
- Behaviour

#### Example  
Some different ways you could collect an Instagram comment:
Plain text {: .label } Captures intellectual content. Doesn't capture look and feel. 
Screenshot {: .label } Captures intellectual content and look and feel. Doesn't capture behavior, and text can't be selected or copy/pasted.
Web archive {: .label } Captures intellectual content, look and feel, and behavior. But it's a more complex format that's harder to use.

Once you know which elements you need and how it needs to be captured, you can detemine which [tool](https://yvonneng.github.io/instagram-collecting/tools-overview)  serves those needs.

## But how do I know what I need?
Start with understanding the intended purpose of your collecting and the requirements for that use, and then work backwards. It may be helpful to consult external standards or protocols in your field.

#### Example
The [Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/OHCHR_BerkeleyProtocol.pdf) provides the first global guidelines for using public digital information – including photos, videos and other information posted to social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube – as evidence in international criminal and human rights investigations.
