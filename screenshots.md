# Full-Page Screenshots 

Screenshots are an easy way to quickly capture Instagram content. 

Screenshots:
- Are a static representation of the page in a still image format.
- Capture the visual appearance (e.g. images, text, colors, fonts) of the page at that moment.  
- Are not dynamic or interactive.

### Firefox

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser has a useful feature to capture "full-page" screenshots that are larger than what you can see on your screen at one time. For example, here is a screenshot of an Instagram page:

It doesn't capture an infinite scroll, but it can capture it in pieces:
